    <p><!-- this is here to put space between summary and words while still keeping the stats table looking like I want AND doesn't put a box around the contained text here. TODO: find a better solution to this. --></p>

- Implemented modular design in [Virtual Fitness Buddy project](Projects/vb-overview) and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.
- Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback. <!-- TODO: here or game design or other? -->
- Implemented virtual reality (VR) tour of 3D modeled heart using Unity3D that competed at the 2016 IEEEVR Conference[^heart-demo]. <!-- TODO: video link?? cite workshop paper? -->
- Iterated bi weekly for [Virtual Fitness Buddy](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-afterschool) on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. <!-- TODO: here or game designer or other?? -->
- Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into [Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-stem-buddy-at-museum) that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span[^vsb1]. <!-- TODO: link to CMOA homepage?? -->
- Optimized input system to accommodate real-world interference and physical safety constraints for elementary school lunchroom and children's museum exhibit environments.


- Prototyped a mixed reality keyboard over 2 months for [Virtual Fitness Buddy](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-afterschool) that succeeded with adults but was unintuitive for children. This led to a design change in the overall project, incorporating a touchscreen, which was intuitive for children to use. <!-- TODO: is this additional sentence good??? -->

## Game Designer

<details open>
    <summary>Skills</summary>

- Designed child intuitive, motion-detection interaction algorithm for using real-world motion as a primary input system used by 410 children (prior to the release of the consumer Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in 2015). <!-- TODO: put a ref here? but to what? dissertation? -->
- Designed a responsive and intuitive jetpack flight system in virtual reality (VR) that resulted in being hired by the Virtual Experiences Lab at the University of Georgia. <!-- TODO: link if there is a specific one for it/its video -->
- Expanded the boundaries of a virtual reality (VR) guided heart tour to give an audience-focused, exploratory experience with minimal navigation friction that improved accessibility[^heart]. <!-- TODO: cite heart demo paper too? -->
- Designed and implemented an engaging physical activity improvement program in collaboration with psychology, kinesiology, engineering, and statistics departments
- Designed a virtual reality (VR) exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool[^fwim] using Unity3D to simplify understanding of heart study[^heart] interactions. <!-- TODO: are cites in good places? cite heart demo paper too? --> <!-- TODO: here, programming, or otherwise? -->


- Designed a 3D trophy model set that rewarded child fitness goals in the [Virtual Fitness Buddy system](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-at-home).

</details>

## Data Engineer

<details open>
    <summary>Skills</summary>

- Designed ETL (TODO: acronym) process to handle virtual buddy player loading under 3 seconds to retain child attention during start up
- Analyzed initial VSB deployment mechanics at CMOA and recommended upgrade resulted in 58% increase (88.3 / 139.8) in engagement with an approximate 10,000 exhibit visitors per year <!-- with 39% increase (13.6 / 18.9) in LH plays/day between upgrades 2 and 3 and in corresponding time frame slingshot saw 9% increase (23.7 / 25.8); 58% (88.3 / 139.8) in play time/game and 15% (100.0 / 115.3) for slingshot -->

### TODO Bullet Points

<details>

<!-- Catherine todos -->
- TODO: turn this into bullet point as elevator pitch on why I was good in field; got it deployed and all they had to do was plug in; captured data when working that met needs of departments involved; app worked for kids; work with parents; was easy on site staff b/c only plugin and turn on tv; managed stakeholders across domains well
  - tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation
- TODO: architectural tradeoffs of tablet placement and ground markers and gameplay+safety (programmer)
  - cost vs making a custom mat that detected when player was out of bounds and not standing in startup location
  - one for hardware; one for software if there is one for VSB otherwise use below for software
- TODO: heart navigation/learning trade-off (software/ux)
- TODO: fix this: Created a data dictionary that reduced the 4 person analysis team's time to understand projection iteration 14 hours per person for VFB
- TODO: VFB watch mentorship
  - Created a reference architecture that was able to guide a junior programmer to create the next evolution of VFB that would allow children to take their buddy with them and get rewards for doing fitness all the time 
    - note: reference finch "self-care", including PA, to say this is a real thing they're already using; market has validated that these ideas work
    - give a comparison to how helpful the reference architecture was
    - a programming win as lead designer of the architecture to help junior programmer
- ~~TODO: C# ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipeline of data from database to app and back~~
  - TODO: Event data log handling ex how I would go about processing the event log by person and session, use pipeline of processing raw event log history into total game sessions or daily game events
    - converting sql log entries into a data event
  - data pipeline of raw event log into series of game events (per player per session)

<!--- Ideas to massage --->
- ~~TODO: add a bullet point for how we managed our feedback collection process~~
- TODO: AR/VR/MR experience - check to see how much these are called out in other bullet points
- TODO: coming up with bark it/agility (blank canvas, small prototype and scrappy too (other minigames too))
  - example of lead programmer behavior/example of ownership of entire process
  - number of times games I came up with were played vs those I didn't (or the initial idea that wasn't mine)
  - coming up with lever hero/slingshot? own bullet point?
- TODO: unity win story? example of experience unity developer choices (scene hierarchy organization)
  - adept at model transform manipulation (to have them grow from a certain point; parenting things to have them move or scale the way I want)
- TODO: C# design patterns (https://refactoring.guru/)
  - gonna need much more massaging
  - my job is to identify patterns I have used or may have used
- TODO: Physics engine vs deterministic tradeoff
  - do you want it to look cool vs be consistent every time
  - why is this an example of an experience unity developer?
  - how would I tell junior devs how to make this tradeoff every time
