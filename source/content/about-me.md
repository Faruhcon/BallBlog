## Final-ish bullet points

<!--- final-ish bullet points --->
- Designed child intuitive, motion-detection interaction algorithm for using real-world motion as a primary input system used by xxx ((thousands of)) children (prior to the release of the consumer Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in 2015). TODO: add numbers
- Optimized input system to accommodate real-world interference and physical safety constraints for elementary school lunchroom and children's museum exhibit environments.
- Collaborated with psychology, kinesiology, engineering, and statistics departments to design an engaging physical activity improvement program validated by game analytics.
- Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback.
- Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span.
- Iterated bi weekly for VFB on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. 
- Implemented modular design in VFB project and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.
- Implemented virtual reality tour of 3D modeled heart using Unity3D that competed at the 2016 IEEEVR Conference. TODO: link paper and demo paper, video??
- Expanded the boundaries of a VR guided heart tour to give an audience-focused, exploratory experience with minimal navigation friction that improved accessibility. (TODO: cite heartx2)
- Designed a virtual reality exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool using Unity3D to simplify understanding of heart study interactions (TODO: cite all 3 fwim+2 heart).
- Designed a responsive and intuitive jetpack flight system in virtual reality that resulted in being hired by the Virtual Experiences Lab. (TODO: link if there is a specific one for it/its video)
- Led and architected the Virtual STEM Buddy experience from conception to implementation which resulted in a 5 year exhibit at the Children's Museum of Atlanta.


- Development team lead on the afterschool Virtual Fitness Buddy project that launched to 155 children across 7 sites and ran 6 months. 
- Prototyped a mixed reality keyboard over 2 months for Virtual Fitness Buddy that succeeded with adults but was unintuitive for children. 
- Designed a 3d trophy model set that rewarded child fitness goals in the Virtual Fitness Buddy system.

## Other bullet points

<!--- Ideas to massage --->
- TODO: add a bullet point for how we managed our feedback collection process
- TODO: how to reach out to the community to get them involved
- TODO: architectural tradeoffs of tablet placement and ground markers and gameplay+safety (programmer and hardware)
- TODO: heart navigation/learning trade-off (software/ux)
- TODO: tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation
- TODO: novel hardware choices (kinect, novint falcon), off the shelf hardware choices (software too?)
- TODO: (programming): notebook on what system stats mean, documentation
- TODO: state machine for vfb/vsb animations and maybe arduino??
- TODO: AR/VR/MR experience
- TODO: C# ETL (extract, transform, and load) pipeline of data from database to app and back
- TODO: VFB watch mentorship
- TODO: coming up with bark it/agility (blank canvas, small prototype and scrappy too (other minigames too))
- TODO: coming up with lever hero/slingshot?
- TODO: simple animations?
- TODO: designed 3d trophy system (trophy itself and pillar) with a 3d modeler
- TODO: adept at model transform manipulation (to have them grow from a certain point; parenting things to have them move or scale the way I want)


<!--- Non-Erin Approved (lol) --->
- Designed robust system used by xxx children across yyy sites which continued to run daily with minimal upkeep for zzz years. TODO: add numbers
- Architected application using MVC & MVVM design patterns to decouple modules for scaling the project.
- ~~Implemented portable designs to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest).~~
  - TODO: describe new hardware and new environments as new bullet point(s), buzz word: portability
