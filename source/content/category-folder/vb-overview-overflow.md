## Virtual Fitness Buddy Summer Camp

<details open> <!-- VFB-C -->
    <summary>VFB-C Info TODO: keep title?</summary>
    <p><!-- TODO: done? -->The Virtual Fitness Buddy Summer Camp (VFB-C) project was designed to encourage children to engage in healthier physical activity (PA) habits through the use of a virtual dog buddy. As a child completed PA goals, tracked using a Fitbit PA tracker, they would earn points to use to unlock new tricks and their VFB's health would increase, meaning that they were slimmer and faster. Unlike the other VFB projects, children could only interact with their VFB by playing fetch and completing tricks without any minigames. VFB-C was built as a mobile kiosk station to be used in a week-long summer camp consisting of a large screen display and Microsoft Kinect. Lastly, the control group for this study also had their own VFB, but they did not earn points to spend.</p>

## Virtual Buddy Fruit and Vegetable Summer Camp

<details open> <!-- VB-F&V -->
    <summary>VB-F&V Info TODO: keep title?</summary>
    <p>The Virtual Buddy Fruit and Vegetable (VB-F&V) project was designed to encourage children to engage in healthier fruit and vegetable (F&V) habits through the use of a virtual dog buddy. As a child ate more fruits and vegetables, tracked by camp counselors, their VB's health would increase, which meant that their heart would be easier to pump, their major artery would be more elastic, and they could complete fetching and tricks faster. As that child met their F&V goals, they would earn credits to spend on performing tricks. VB-F&V was built as a station to be used in a week-long summer camp consisting of a Mac and Novint Falcon (haptic joystick).</p>

    <p>As part of this app, I implemented two different VB health checks: arterial elasticity and heart pumping. They were designed to represent different aspects of a child's VB. See below for more details on these health checks. In addition to these health checks, children were able to get their VFB to perform tricks and/or play fetch by spending trick credits earned through meeting their F&V goals.</p>
