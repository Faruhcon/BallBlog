# What is the Virtual Fitness Buddy?
</div>

insert VFB arch picture here

I worked on the Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) system and its prototypes for over a decade. The core tennet of the VFB system is to encourage children to engage in healthier physical activity (PA) habits. This was done through the use of a virtual buddy in the form of a customizable virtual dog and a PA tracker. As a child engaged in PA, their VFB's health would level up, which meant that they could play for longer and could unlock new minigames and tricks to perform. As that child met their daily PA goals, they would earn points to be used in the shop for VFB customizations and additional toys for fetch. This separation was made so that all PA would be rewarded in becoming healthier while still encouraging the child to set realistic PA goals without penalizing them from new playable content.

For this project, I have worn many hats over the years as we had a small dev team. My primary focus was designing, programming, and testing the VFB Unity3D application itself, which included the script architecture, user interfaces, world layout, minigame implementation, data formatting and processing, and input control systems. Basically, if you see it in the game, I more than likely had my hand in it. I even dabbled with basic art and audio design. Additionally, I helped to design our second kiosk in terms of testing the potential new hardware and hardware upgrades for feasibility and assembly. Lastly, while we largely had two developers for these apps, I did lead a team of undergrads consisting of both programmers and artists for some time.

In terms of the overall study, I also wore many hats while working on an interdisciplinary team. Since I was one of the primary developers, I was tasked with system troubleshooting both remotely and on-site once our systems were deployed in the field, communicating with site directors for problems and pain points that they noticed. I also was a primary tech support when a parent and/or child had any issues with data entry or PA trackers, walking parents through tracker setup when necessary. For our statisticians, I aided in gathering system and application data, getting the desired data into a more readily processible format. For our psychologists and kinesiologists, I translated study goals into actionable application elements. Lastly, I both designed the program to perform data analysis and analyzed gameplay metrics, looking for information on what to adjust for future versions of the VFB system.

Various systems were used throughout the lifetime of the VFB project. Our first two systems (refx2?) utilized a mobile kiosk which consisted of a large screen TV along with a PC and Microsoft Kinect (ref?), where children used their physical bodies as the primary method of interacting with their VFB (fig ref?). The idea was to avoid having the children engage in sedentary activity when playing with their VFB while also mimicking real life motions to aid in fostering the bond between a child and their VFB. From both these early studies and the Virtual STEM Buddy (VSB) (make into link to its page) project, we learned that utilizing a touchscreen for more complex selection interactions was much easier and understandable over mid-air interaction techniques with the Kinect. Thus, we added a touchscreen to the second iteration of our kiosk (fig ref?). 

These kiosks were designed to be used in public spaces. Thus with the onset of the COVID pandemic, we needed to change our approach to continue conducting these studies. This resulted in our iPad iteration of the VFB system (ref) (fig ref?). We sought to keep as much of the real-world movement as possible, utilizing augmented reality (AR) techniques for camera movement and aiming while utilizing the touchscreen through the use of digital joysticks and buttons for locomotion and throwing. Additionally, we were better able to utilize voice activated interactions for performing tricks as the microphone would be close to the child while they interacted with their VFB. This shift allowed the VFB system to be usable in many different home setups.

The last iteration of the VFB system I worked on was the immersive, virtual reality (VR) based system which utilized the Meta Quest 2 (dissertation ref?). We returned to the real world movement of our kiosk-based VFB systems, adapting several of the minigames to the new explorable VFB world designed for the iPad-based VFB system. I also briefly worked on early prototypes of the watch companion app that was in development as I was graduating. This was an idea my professor and I had talked about for a long time. The watch app would allow children to take their VFB with them on walks, which we thought would help foster their bond.

Some additional notes:

While all version of vfb had voice activation, it was often hard to use in the afterschool settings because loud

Our second iteration of this kiosk added a touchscreen because mid air interaction hard

This journey began in summer camp settings

learned and grew from the older projects and also vb-f&v and vsb-m, which will be discussed in more detail on the following pages

something something (on the specific page for it): tried to have the physical fitness go down but we were too harsh on it and for the sake of the study, opted to remove this feature as we did not have time to properly test it in the lab before the next iterations
