is there already a concept of figure or do I need to make one?

I was a core developer for the Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) system and its prototypes for nearly a decade, ending with my graduation from the University of Georgia in Fall 2023. The guiding priciple for the VFB system is to encourage children to engage in healthier physical activity (PA) habits. This was achieved using a customizable virtual dog and a PA tracker. As a child engaged in PA, their VFB could play for longer and could unlock new minigames and tricks to perform. As that child met their daily PA goals, they would earn points to purchase VFB and toy customizations. This distinction was made so that all PA would be rewarded in becoming healthier while still encouraging the child to set realistic PA goals without penalizing them from new playable content. During this time, we grew this system from our pilot studies at a single summer camp site with xxx children total to yyy children across zzz sites utilizing a mulimillion dollar grant.

Header: My Responsibilities

Given our team size, I performed many tasks for the Virtual Fitness Buddy (VFB) project over its life cycle ranging from brainstorming initial designs to deploying it on-site. For simplicity, I have condensed these tasks into the following roles:

- Programmer
- Game Designer
- UI/UX Designer
- Hardware Designer
- QA
- Development Team Lead
- Data Engineer
- On-site/Field Consultant
- Tech Support

TODO: add subheaders for each of the roles above?? with links in the above list to these subsections with even more info than is contained in the paragraphs below? Markdown headings to autogenerate list?

Additional information regarding these roles are enumerated in the following sections.

Expand on the list above with what I did for each role so folks know what they're getting when hiring me for these roles. Don't forget the buzzwords like SQL, etc

For this project, my primary focus was designing, programming, and testing the VFB Unity3D application itself, which included the script architecture, user interfaces, world layout, minigame implementation, data formatting and processing, and input control systems. I even dabbled with basic art and audio design. Basically, if you see it in the game, I more than likely had my hand in it. Additionally, I helped to design our second kiosk in terms of testing the potential new hardware and hardware upgrades for feasibility and assembly. Lastly, while we largely had two developers for these apps, I did lead a team of undergrads consisting of both programmers and artists for some time.

In terms of the overall study, I had additional responsibilites while working with our interdisciplinary team. Since I was one of the primary developers, I was tasked with system troubleshooting both remotely and on-site once our systems were deployed in the field, communicating with site directors for any issues or pain points that they noticed. I also was a primary tech support when a parent and/or child had any issues with data entry or PA trackers, walking parents through tracker setup when necessary. For our statisticians, I aided in gathering system and application data, getting the desired data into a more readily processible format. For our psychologists and kinesiologists, I translated study goals into actionable application elements. Lastly, I both designed the program to perform data analysis and analyzed gameplay metrics, looking for information on what to adjust for future versions of the VFB system.

Various systems were used throughout the lifetime of the VFB project. Our first two systems (refx2?) utilized a mobile kiosk which consisted of a large screen TV along with a PC and Microsoft Kinect (ref?), where children used their physical bodies as the primary method of interacting with their VFB (fig ref?). The idea was to avoid having the children engage in sedentary activity when playing with their VFB while also mimicking real life motions to aid in fostering the bond between a child and their VFB. From both these early studies and the Virtual STEM Buddy (VSB) (make into link to its page) project, we learned that utilizing a touchscreen for more complex selection interactions was much easier and understandable over mid-air interaction techniques with the Kinect. Thus, we added a touchscreen to the second iteration of our kiosk (fig ref?). 

These kiosks were designed to be used in public spaces. Thus with the onset of the COVID pandemic, we needed to change our approach to continue conducting these studies. This resulted in our iPad iteration of the VFB system (ref) (fig ref?). We sought to keep as much of the real-world movement as possible, utilizing augmented reality (AR) techniques for camera movement and aiming while utilizing the touchscreen through the use of digital joysticks and buttons for locomotion and throwing. Additionally, we were better able to utilize voice activated interactions for performing tricks as the microphone would be close to the child while they interacted with their VFB. This shift allowed the VFB system to be usable in many different home setups.

The last iteration of the VFB system I worked on was the immersive, virtual reality (VR) based system which utilized the Meta Quest 2 (dissertation ref?). We returned to the real world movement of our kiosk-based VFB systems, adapting several of the minigames to the new explorable VFB world designed for the iPad-based VFB system. I also briefly worked on early prototypes of the watch companion app that was in development as I was graduating. This was an idea my professor and I had talked about for a long time. The watch app would allow children to take their VFB with them on walks, which we thought would help foster their bond.

Some additional notes:

While all version of vfb had voice activation, it was often hard to use in the afterschool settings because loud

Our second iteration of this kiosk added a touchscreen because mid air interaction hard

This journey began in summer camp settings

something something (on the specific page for it): tried to have the physical fitness go down but we were too harsh on it and for the sake of the study, opted to remove this feature as we did not have time to properly test it in the lab before the next iterations
