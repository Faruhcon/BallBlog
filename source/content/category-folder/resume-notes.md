#### Iterative design with feedback

- took in feedback from multidisciplinary team on prototypes

Based on feedback from our multiple disciplinary team, study site staff, and participants, I built and iterated upon various virtual buddy systems (page link?).

- From our multiple disciplinary team, I garnered feedback regarding alignment with larger study goals and adjusted designs accordingly to better target these goals.
  - psychology (communications), statistics, kinesiology, and engineering
  - p/s/k, presented weekly prototypes for feedback
  - engr, 
  - pet health = old PA*0.9 + new PA*0.1

##### Bringing four departments together

Psyc+kine = here's what we want
engr = here's how to do it
Stats = here's how it did and other data metrics

<!--- Brainstorming --->
Was able to synthesize requirements from the psychology and kinesiology departments with the capabilities of the engineering department and measure its success from the statisticians on making an engaging physical activity improvement program.

Based on study requirements from the psychology and kinesiology departments, 

Collaborated with psychology, kinesiology, engineering, and statistics departments to design an engaging physical activity improvement program validated by game analytics.


##### Participant feedback

- From child participants, I garnered feedback on the application interactions including what they enjoyed or found frustrating.

Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback.

in person, anecdotal, live feedback
end of study questionnaire feedback
game performance and metrics

- TODO: add a bullet point for how we managed our feedback collection process

Selection techniques - hover select to 3D keyboard to touchscreen
Minigame mechanics - hated blaster


##### Site Feedback

STEM buddy

TODO: how to reach out to the community to get them involved
TODO: architectural tradeoffs of tablet placement and ground markers and gameplay+safety

Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span.

##### Iterative Design Stuff

bi weekly meetings and iterations

story about time when quickly innovated with feedback from partners

split goal and PA

Iterated bi weekly for VFB on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. 

TODO: novel hardware choices (kinect, novint falcon)

into gameplay stats

 impacted game design decisions

stat: data collection and gathering
psyc/kine: PA to VFB impact
psyc: minigames, overall design, skeleton
paper writing

##### Unity/Programming Stuff

TODO: unreal blueprint system
TODO: cool unity stuff

Multiplatform

I was able to take my vfb and port it easily with minimal changes using engine native capabilities for ios, android, vr, kinect

preprocessor directives, conditional compilation

Designed VFB architecture in s

Implemented modular design in VFB project and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.

to use Unity3D multiplatform deployment for VFB ()

TODO: simulation - fwim
TODO: navigation - heart tour




Understanding trade offs of user experience and navigation

recognize that the value of experience was guided navigation and not free form nav - focus energy on importance of the tour itself rather than the novel concept of 3d heart to explore

Designed virtual reality tour of 3D modeled heart using Unity3D that competed at 2016 IEEEVR Conference. TODO: link paper and demo paper

Expanded the boundaries of a VR guided heart tour to give an audience-focused, exploratory experience with minimal navigation friction that improved accessibility. (TODO: cite heartx2)

Designed a virtual reality exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool using Unity3D to simplify understanding of heart study interactions (TODO: cite all 3 fwim+2 heart).

worrying about navigation

not free form with no rails but targeted a technique that let them forget about navigation

with a novel navigation system - on track, compact, didn't care about turns

realized a conceptual 3d modeled heart tour
