#### Iterative design with feedback

- took in feedback from multidisciplinary team on prototypes

Based on feedback from our multiple disciplinary team, study site staff, and participants, I built and iterated upon various virtual buddy systems (page link?).

- From our multiple disciplinary team, I garnered feedback regarding alignment with larger study goals and adjusted designs accordingly to better target these goals.
  - psychology (communications), statistics, kinesiology, and engineering
  - p/s/k, presented weekly prototypes for feedback
  - engr, 
  - pet health = old PA*0.9 + new PA*0.1

##### Bringing four departments together

Psyc+kine = here's what we want
engr = here's how to do it
Stats = here's how it did and other data metrics

<!--- Brainstorming --->
Was able to synthesize requirements from the psychology and kinesiology departments with the capabilities of the engineering department and measure its success from the statisticians on making an engaging physical activity improvement program.

Based on study requirements from the psychology and kinesiology departments, 

Collaborated with psychology, kinesiology, engineering, and statistics departments to design an engaging physical activity improvement program validated by game analytics.


##### Participant feedback

- From child participants, I garnered feedback on the application interactions including what they enjoyed or found frustrating.

Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback.

in person, anecdotal, live feedback
end of study questionnaire feedback
game performance and metrics

- TODO: add a bullet point for how we managed our feedback collection process

Selection techniques - hover select to 3D keyboard to touchscreen
Minigame mechanics - hated blaster


##### Site Feedback

STEM buddy

TODO: how to reach out to the community to get them involved
TODO: architectural tradeoffs of tablet placement and ground markers and gameplay+safety

Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span.

##### Iterative Design Stuff

bi weekly meetings and iterations

story about time when quickly innovated with feedback from partners

split goal and PA

Iterated bi weekly for VFB on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. 

TODO: novel hardware choices (kinect, novint falcon)

into gameplay stats

 impacted game design decisions

stat: data collection and gathering
psyc/kine: PA to VFB impact
psyc: minigames, overall design, skeleton
paper writing
