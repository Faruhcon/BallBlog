</div>

COMING SOON


<!--- ### Programmer

- From UI/UX Designer
  - TODO: add input systems
    - User Controls
      - User input processing
  - TODO: add aids
  - TODO: add changing lever hero
  - TODO: add login mechanisms
- Languages and Platforms
  - Unity3D application scripting was largely me (C#)
  - Android and PC development
  - SQL to interact with database and query it
  - Python/Pandas for data analysis and visualizations
- Minigame Related
  - Minigames
    - Lever Hero
    - Slingshot/Trajectory
- Virtual Buddy Related
- Architecture
  - Game script architecture design
    - MVC and MVVM approaches
      - make user controls independent of agent behavior
        - easier to swap out hardware without having to change a million different broken scripts
        - easier to swap other stuff too
  - Data architecture design (JSON)

- more coming soon

### UI/UX Designer

- Input Systems

    - Grab
- Aids (what kind???)
  - lever hero rotate arrows as visual aids
  - audio and text for CMOA in case user without parents and cannot read (well)
  - Trajectory for slingshot shown -- higher difficulties would be removed or shortened

  - App relaunch software in case of crash
- Environmental considerations
  - safety
  - convenience
- Login Mechanisms
- Changing lever hero from auto balance to balance when placed
