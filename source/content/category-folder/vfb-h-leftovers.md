### Participant Focused Game Play Metrics

During preliminary analysis, we found that, once again, there was a decline in logins over time (Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-weekly-logins}). However, logins may not be the best proxy for engagement in this case. Participants could log in often but that does not mean that they were engaging with their VFB as they may not have stayed logged in long enough to do so. To address this drawback, we began looking at how many times and for how long participants spent playing minigames. Similar to overall login time, simply because they had started a minigame does not mean they always used this time to actually play the minigames. However, the impact of not utilizing this time is likely lower than that of being logged in and doing nothing for a long time. This is due to the fact that the minigames are timed, so, at most, a single minigame would add 60 seconds to the minigame play time. The one exception to this rule is the Bark It minigame, which does not have a time out. Additionally, the minigames were designed such that participants would be directly interacting with their VFB. As such, exploring how often and how long they were played may provide more insight into what it means to be engaged with the system. The participants showcased here are participants who at least played one game throughout the course of their respective study. There are 19 participants from C1-H and 6 participants from C2-H in this dataset, which includes the child participants cited above along with their family units.

\end{figure}--->

As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info}, there seems to be a similar trend between the number of games played and the amount of time the games were played across participants. This may indicate that many of the games were played to completion and/or that participants did not press the start/end game buttons repeatedly. There are also two individuals who played the minigames much more than the rest both for number of game plays and amount of time played. Given that games were unlocked at different levels, participants likely did not unlock minigames at the same relative time during the study. Given this, not all play counts nor play times are created equal. For example, C1-H participants received an update on October 5, 2021, which was, at most, around 38 days after they began to have access to their VFB, pending participant start date. This update released new versions (V2) of each minigame and removed the old versions (V1). This means that C1-H participants had access to the V2 versions for at most 75 days (pending participant start and end dates). C2-H participants had access to V2 games for at most 105 days. %Participant's max access days and days unlocked for each game can be seen in table xxxx.

<!--- %TODO: table here on access/unlocks--->

Given this difference in duration of VFB access, we opted to examine how many games and how much time participants played while controlling for the number of days they had access to each game (Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info-per}). This results in participant 50121 overtaking 60042 in relative play time and games played. This means that while participant 60042 played more games, they did so across more unlock days compared to participant 50121, which is true given than participant 60042 had access to all games for 105 days and 50121 had access to V1 games for 31 days and V2 for 67 days for a total of 98 days. Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info-per} also shows us that most participants (approximately 92\%) played games for less than two minutes per day with approximately a third of participants playing under 10 seconds per day. This is much less than we had anticipated.

Given that some participants were adult guardians, perhaps they did not play as much as the child participants. As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info-per-sep}, guardians only account for 4 of the 9 participants with time played per day under 10 seconds with three guardians playing around 30 seconds or more per day. Thus, this is not a sufficient explanation to solely explain the low play time per day.

### Minigame Focused Metrics
In addition to how much time participants spent playing the minigames, the variety of games they played is also of interest. We expected that participants would prefer a variety of games over a single game in particular. As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-basic-game-plays}, there seems to be a preference for Soccer in both cohorts with Agility and Bark It being the least preferred. There also seems to be the same number of relative plays across both versions of the minigames. However, as mentioned earlier, different minigames were unlocked at different levels and unlocked by participants and their families potentially at different times. Agility and Bark It are the last two games to be unlocked at levels 4 and 5 respectively. By controlling for the number of days each family had access to each game, we can account for these different unlock times. This also allows us to control for the fact that the first versions (V1) of the minigames were only accessible for at most approximately 45 days by C1-H, whereas the second versions (V2) were accessible for the remainder of C1-H and the entirety of C2-H. As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-basic-game-plays-perDay}, the V2 minigames were played much less controlling for days than the V1.

Rather than being indicative of the relative success of each version of the minigames, this could be partially due to the novelty effect, where we generally have seen much higher plays earlier on in our VFB studies than compared to later. In that case, the V1 minigames would have been played at the peak of interest in the system, inflating their overall play metrics compared to V2, which provides a view into how games were played throughout the duration of the study. Additionally, as previously mentioned, V1 games were only accessible for around 38 days whereas V2 games were accessible for around 67 days (C1-H) and 105 days (C2-H). V2 plays and time played per day may be suppressed due to V2 minigames being accessible for most of the study rather than solely at a potential peak play period. Although there are 13 more C1-H participants than C2-H, the number of participants who played each version are much closer with 17 participants who played the V1 games and 15 participants who played the V2 games.

<!--- %As shown in Fig xxx, the play times/counts per week of each game are show and Fig yyy shows the contiguous play time/play count per week--->

As shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info},~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info-per}, and ~\ref{fig:vfbh-participant-play-info-per-sep}, we have two participants that played far more than the rest. As such, when examining the number of games played and time spent playing them, our previous graphs are skewed by those two participants' preferences. By looking at their play time individually across all of the games they played, we see that both of these participants had a substantial preference for the Soccer minigames (Figures ~\ref{fig:vfbh-outliers-time-somuchtime} and ~\ref{fig:vfbh-outliers-time-somuchtime-2}).

\end{figure}--->

As shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-outliers-removed-time-all}, the preference towards the Soccer minigame was reduced for both V1 and V2 upon removing these participants from the overall play data. The play time was reduced so much that other minigames overtook Soccer in terms of overall playtime across both C1-H and C2-H. Additionally, with those outliers removed, the amount of time played for each game became more comparable than those shown in Figures ~\ref{fig:vfbh-basic-game-plays} and ~\ref{fig:vfbh-basic-game-plays-perDay}.

Also shown in ~\ref{fig:vfbh-outliers-removed-time-all}, both versions of Agility and Soccer V2 were played about half as long as the other minigames. It also happens that Agility is the last game unlocked at level 5. However, when controlling for days, this trend still persists and as such, there are likely other factors contributing to this lower play time. That being said, Agility along with Basketball and Soccer all require participants to maneuver quickly, including rotating the camera. Bark It, Frisbee and Volleyball can all be played by standing in a single position without moving the camera. Thus, revisiting Agility's gameplay mechanics for future iterations may provide more insight here.

Lastly for minigame metrics, as mentioned, the variety of games participants played over time is of interest. We expected that participants would tend to prefer a variety of games throughout the course of the study. Initial attempts at visualizing gameplays in a timeline format were incredibly crowded and hard to read. Instead, we used a combination of Gantt charts (Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-mr-gantt}) and line graphs (Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-weekly-plays}). Due to the sporadic nature of daily game plays, we binned game plays into weeks since the start of the study.

    \label{fig:vfbh-weekly-plays}
\end{figure}--->

Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-mr-gantt} shows the study weeks with contiguous plays for each minigame. A contiguous play is consituted as at least a single minigame being played across chronological weeks with smaller bars representing weeks where a game was not played the week prior nor the week after. This means that the progression of a bar on the graph does not represent individual plays occurring each day of the week. As shown, a variety of games were played throughout the course of both cohorts. The provides support that participants preferred variety over the course of the study if they interact with their VFB and play games.

Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-weekly-plays} depicts the quantity of game plays for each game during the week. As shown, C1-H V1 games were played more than their V2 counterparts for both C1-H and C2-H, which is similar to our previously mentioned findings. They also follow the trend of decreasing over the course of the study. The immediate drop off in plays for C1-H after week 5 can be explained by the participant 50121, who had many more game plays than the rest of their cohort, not playing as many games as before the V2 update (Figure ~\ref{fig:plays-line-50121} ~\ref{fig:c1h-line-outlierremoved}), greatly reducing the difference in game plays between V1 and V2. Similarly, the C2-H participant 60042 contributed many of the plays to C2-H each week (Figure ~\ref{fig:plays-line-60042} ~\ref{fig:c2h-line-outlierremoved}).

### VFB Level Increases

The dataset used to examine VFB level increases is not the same data set as the previous one. While there is overlap, this data set includes participants from both cohorts who had their VFB's level increase at least once. This captures most of our participants as a level increase occurs immediately following VFB creation to set its initial level. Lastly, participants are grouped together into their family units as when the VFB level increases for a single member, it increases for their entire family.

As previously mentioned, each game unlocked at a different level. This may contribute to the differences in relative gameplay metrics. Figures ~\ref{fig:vfbh-levelups} show VFB level increases by family for C1-H and C2-H respectively. Depicted in these figures are three red, vertical lines depicting the start and end dates for each cohort with a week removed from the start given that participants did not have access to their VFB for the first week for both cohorts. The third vertical line depicts 38 days after the earliest start time for each cohort. This line corresponds to the V2 update C1-H received on October 5, 2021, with the equivalent date (May 3, 2022) shown for C2-H. Given that all games were unlocked by level 5, this means that most participants for both C1-H and C2-H had all of the available games unlocked between 2 and 3 weeks after receiving their VFB.

    \label{fig:vfbh-levelups}
\end{figure}--->

Given that C1-H participants continued to level their VFB not only for a longer period but also higher levels after the V2 update compared to C2-H, it may be beneficial to consider adding additional content intermittently throughout the study as a means to sustain participant engagement throughout the course of the study. 
    
### Family Reviews

In order for the participants to be able to increase the level of their VFB and, thereby, to unlock more games and earn more points, they needed to complete a family review so that their physical activity (PA) data would be applied to their VFB. The family reviews were intended to be used for the family to assess and discuss their physical activity (PA) data. We anticipated each family would complete a family review once per week. However, as shown in in Figures ~\ref{fig:famrev-line}, this was not the case given that there were 16 families in C1-H and 9 in C2-H, that goal was never met. Although, C2-H did have eight family reviews during the first week. As with our other metrics, family reviews also saw a decrease over time.

    \label{fig:famrev-line}
\end{figure}--->


Figures ~\ref{fig:famrev-gantt} the number of family reviews for each participant family per week, where a solid bar connecting weeks denotes that there was at least one family review each week contiguously. Family 6004, which contained our gameplay outlier mentioned earlier, had the most weeks with a family review for C2-H, which may be a contributing factor as to why they played more games than every other participant in their cohort combined. The same does not hold true for C1-H as the participant with the most gameplays was a member of family 5012. In fact, family 5001 was amongst the families with the lowest play time and game plays. Thus, by simply looking at the quantity and overall timing of family reviews, this seems to indicate that quantity nor consistency of family reviews relate to the quantity of time played nor game plays. However, given that many participants had all of the games unlocked by the third week of the study, there may not have been time for the consistency of family reviews to impact gameplay as they already had everything in that regard.

Lastly, a Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationships between quantity of family reviews and any of the previous stats discussed, such as number of level ups and play time per day. Figure ~\ref{fig:heatmap} depicts the results of this correlation as a heatmap with the significance results for family reviews in Figure ~\ref{fig:heatmap-corr}. There were strong, positive correlations between the number of review days and most of the other metrics except for login days. Of those, max level (r=.70, n=25, p<.01), number of level ups (r=.86, n=25, p<0.001), plays per day (r=0.77, n=25, p<0.01), and play time per day (r=.71, n=25, p<.01) are significant. All of this seems to indicate that there is a relationship between family reviews and interaction with the VFB system that needs to be explored further. The relationship between number of family reviews and level ups also seems to indicate that individuals who did complete a family review tended to level up, which was to be expected. The reverse is always true as a level up could not happen without a family review. However, there are at least two conditions in which participants could complete family reviews without leveling up their VFB. The first is simply not meeting the required physical activity necessary to reach their VFB's next level. The other is that they never logged into the VFB system again but continued to complete family reviews. As indicated in previous sections, we do have participants that did not engage with the VFB system beyond the first few weeks of their cohort.

## Conclusions

From the C2-H results, most participants stopped playing games, completing family reviews, and leveling their VFB with over a month left still remaining in the study. In fact, no other participant leveled their VFB after late May 2022 with two months left in the study except for participant 60042. This explains why their game play metrics were so high compared to the other participants in their cohort as they continued to engage with the VFB-H system for at least a month longer than the remainder of C2-H. Similarly, only one other family had any family reviews after the eighth week of the study, which would be around mid-May 2022. Other participants did continue to play games with their VFB until the eleventh week of the study (early June 2022). Thus, it may be worthwhile to explore if there were other external factors that may have contributed to this lack of engagement during the C2-H cohort. For example, C2-H took place during Spring and Summer 2022. Prior to the end of the study, our participants started their summer break, which approximately coincided with the aforementioned time when most of the C2-H participants ceased engaging with their VFBs. Conversely, C1-H took place during Fall 2021 and concluded prior to winter break. The timing of these studies may have contributed to their overall engagement levels.

C1-H did not experience the same degree of low engagement as C2-H had. Even with the gameplay outlier removed, there were still games being played through week 14 (early December 2021) by other participants. Several participant families continued to level their VFBs almost through the end of the study. There were 11 families who continued to level their VFB beyond two months prior to the end of the study, which was when C2-H stopped having increased levels apart from family 6004. Similarly, at least 10 families continued to have family reviews after week 8 (late October 2021). Given this, it would be worthwhile to further explore why C2-H had such low extended engagement compared to C1-H.

Regarding whether or not participants tended to prefer variety in gameplay versus focusing primarily on one or two games throughout the study, both of the participants with the most plays preferred the soccer minigame. Although, they both did play other minigames throughout the course of the study with participant 60042 playing a variety of games nearly every week throughout the course of the study. All games continued to have plays through the end of the C1-H study except for bark it, which was not played after the eleventh week of the study (mid-November 2021). The agility minigame had the least number of plays throughout the study without excluding the outlier and soccer receiving the least number of plays otherwise. It may be worthwhile to revisit the agility gameplay mechanics if it is included as a game in future studies. It may also be worthwhile to explore how participants played the agility minigames utilizing additional data we collected regarding participants’ virtual locomotion. 

In summary, the data seems to indicate that having a variety of games to play is likely to be beneficial. Certain participants may find a particular game to be their favorite and focus on it, as was the case for participants 50121 and 60042, but overall, many of the minigames continued to be played throughout the course of the study. Even participant 60042 continued to play other games while playing the soccer minigame each week. Participant 50121 also played different games each week with soccer as the predominant game.

Lastly, the correlation data seems to point toward there being an interaction between family reviews and VFB game play metrics. As mentioned earlier, it was expected that there would be a correlation between increasing the level of the VFB and completing a family review as family reviews are required for a level up to occur. This held true as there was a strong, positive, and significant correlation between the number of level ups and number of days with a family review. There were also strong, positive, and significant correlations between the number of days with a family review and plays per day and play time per day. Thus, further exploration into the timing of family reviews and gameplay metrics may reveal more details about these relationships. This, in turn, would help inform our decision on whether to keep progress gated behind family reviews or to lax this requirement. For example, a compromise might be delaying the impact of participants’ physical activity (PA) for a short while without a family review while completing a family review immediately allows their PA to improve their VFB. This way we are still encouraging the family reviews while not causing a complete standstill of VFB progress.  

### Future Directions

There is a lot more data to examine from the VFB-H data set. For example, we enabled both real-world and virtual movement systems for VFB-H and recorded this data for every session. We intended for participants to use the virtual joysticks to locomote through the virtual world with a combination of real-world and virtual joystick-based movement for rotating their view. Figure ~\ref{fig:vfbh-motion} shows our preliminary results from this data set, which only consists of locomotion data without any view rotation data. We expected participants to largely use the joystick locomotion system due to potentially restricted real-world space, which is what happened. It was unexpected for real-world locomotion to constitute over 20\% of the overall locomotion as we did not design our mechanics around real-world locomotion, only real-world rotation. With both their locomotion and rotation data, we can recreate their path and gaze direction and match this movement with our event log to determine if this movement was used during a particular minigame.

The additional data from these studies include metrics such as how much energy participants used per play session, items they purchased, tricks they had their VFB perform, and their minigame high scores over time. We could also further explore the data from this dissertation, such as combining our knowledge of the participants who played the bulk of the games for their respective cohorts with how they moved throughout the virtual world and what other actions they performed in their play sessions. A final example would be further exploring the relationship between family reviews and VFB interactions, such as to assess whether participants generally interact with their VFB more following a family review or not.

Additionally, we had designed a few new mechanics that we were unable to implement into the C2-H VFB system. For example, given the continued engagement decline over time, we had two main categories of changes: alerts and new content. The alerts primarily targeted their physical activity data, such as alerts upon login indicating how many points and levels were waiting for them to complete a family review and another pop up to show participants the trophy or trophies they earned based on their PA since their last login. Both of these alerts are intended to indicate to participants the impact of their PA while also providing additional incentive to complete a family review. While removing the requirement of completing a family review to incorporate their PA into the VFB-H system may increase gameplay, the family reviews are still an important part to the VFB ecosystem as a whole as they provide an opportunity for participants to learn the impact of their PA throughout the week, and thus, the impact of their PA on not only their VFB's health but also their own. Thus, an approach where perhaps participants are still able to unlock minigames but not earn points to spend at the shop until they complete a family review may be more appropriate for the overall goals of this project rather than cutting their impact on the VFB-H interaction entirely.

The other category of updates included additional content for participants to unlock. As uncovered in this dissertation, many of our participants had unlocked most of the minigames rather early on in the study, leaving them with no new games or tricks to unlock for the remainder of the study. A direct way to address this, apart from extending the PA required to unlock everything, would be to add new content. This new content could include new minigames (e.g., tug of war or baseball) or new modes for existing minigames (e.g., competitive volleyball, bark it random fail mode, playing as a goalie during soccer in order to block the VFB's oncoming shots). Another avenue of increased content includes adding additional items to the VFB shop for purchase. For example, we could add the ability to customize their VFB level up or trophy animations, such as being able to select which trick appears for the highest-level trophy or additional fanfare when they level up, such as clapping or fireworks. This could also include adding new VFB and VFB toy customization options into the virtual shop.

## Lessons Learned

This at-home VFB system is the first time any of our VFB system directly competed with other forms of entertainment. Previously, our studies took place in public places where our participants were not likely to have a tablet or a gaming system. As such, this is likely a contributor regarding our lower engagement statistics with these two cohorts. As we have discovered in our previous studies, we tend to have high levels of novelty effect. The novelty of our systems is an effective way to maintain engagement with our participants. Unfortunately, as we have seen, this novelty effect only supports engagement on its own for so long, which was showcased with this data set especially as engagement decreased over time, especially for C2-H. An approach to maintain engagement through this novelty factor is to introduce more content over time, which was another difference with these at-home cohorts as participants unlocked all of the minigames relatively early in the study. This meant that there was no additional content for participants to unlock for the duration of the study. Given that there are other entertainment pressures at home, all of this means that we should reconsider our approach for designing minigames and other interactions for future at-home systems.

We did learn that participants tended to play different games over time, which provides support toward adding additional content to help sustain engagement for longer durations. Interestingly, once we removed the effect of our outlier plays, Frisbee, the VFB-A equivalent of Slingshot, was the most played game for this at-home system with the Volleyball minigame also having high play time. This nearly mimics our results from the afterschool VFB system, where Slingshot, Volleyball, and Soccer were the most played games. Given the mechanical similarities between Frisbee and Slingshot and between the two Volleyball games, this would indicate that the mechanics, e.g., large targets to hit and paddle-like interactions, behind these games are enjoyed by participants. Thus, it may be worthwhile to leverage this information to design other games with these or similar mechanics.

Lastly, while engagement did decrease over time, participants still engaged with the VFB system for a time. This means that we did successfully compete with the aforementioned additional entertainment pressures in the home environment in the short term. Similar to how we learned many lessons through the course of all of our previous public space-based studies, this study is the beginning of learning new lessons with this entirely new environment. Additionally, these two at-home cohorts had vastly fewer participants than their afterschool counterparts, which means lowered engagement from these participants has a much larger impact on our outcomes. Thus, perhaps, what we considered to be game play outliers may actually be more representative of typical engagement outcomes instead of exemplary ones.
