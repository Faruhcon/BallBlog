## Virtual Fitness Buddy at Home

TODO: insert interface pic here?

The Virtual Fitness Buddy Home (VFB-H) project was designed to encourage children to engage in healthier physical activity (PA) habits through the use of a virtual buddy (a dog). As a child completed PA, tracked using a Fitbit PA tracker, their VFB's health would increase, which meant that they could play for longer, unlock new games and tricks, and earn points to spend on various customizations. VFB-H was built as an iPad app that children could use at home, utilizing touchscreen, voice-activation, and real-life motion as ways to interact with the system.

As part of this app, I designed six different minigames: agility, BarkIt, basketball, frisbee, soccer, and volleyball. See below for more details on these games. I implemented leaderboards that would track their top 3 personal scores in addition to the top 3 scores for their family and across the entire study for each minigame. In addition to these games, children were able to get their VFB to perform tricks using their voice and could play fetch without having to interact with a minigame.

In addition to designing and implementing these minigames, I was also responsible for the following:

* Designing and implementing
  * New park layout to allow for exploration TODO: pic?
  * Virtual kiosks to start/stop games, display instructions, and show leaderboards TODO: pic?
  * Speech to text (STT) for VFB tricks using Google's STT API
  * Arrow navigation system to show players where to go for their next objective TODO: pic?
  * Trophy system that dynamically changed size as players met higher and higher activity goals TODO: pic?
* Adding sound effects to the park, including ball bouncing sounds, cheers, and dings 
  * These sound effects were used to add some more realism to the app
  * Additionally, they were used to provide feedback that the player was completing tasks correctly
* Recording and editing a video to show how to use the VFB-H app (for the pilot, include?)
* Setting up the iPads to auto-update when we issued updates to the app
* Bug troubleshooting and fixes for both VFB app and Fitbit syncing
* Data analysis on game play metrics
