    <p><!-- this is here to put space between summary and words while still keeping the stats table looking like I want AND doesn't put a box around the contained text here. TODO: find a better solution to this. --></p>

- Implemented modular design in [Virtual Fitness Buddy project](Projects/vb-overview) and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.
- Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback. <!-- TODO: here or game design or other? -->
- Implemented virtual reality (VR) tour of 3D modeled heart using Unity3D that competed at the 2016 IEEEVR Conference[^heart-demo]. <!-- TODO: video link?? cite workshop paper? -->
- Iterated bi weekly for [Virtual Fitness Buddy](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-afterschool) on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. <!-- TODO: here or game designer or other?? -->
- Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into [Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-stem-buddy-at-museum) that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span[^vsb1]. <!-- TODO: link to CMOA homepage?? -->
- Optimized input system to accommodate real-world interference and physical safety constraints for elementary school lunchroom and children's museum exhibit environments.


- Prototyped a mixed reality keyboard over 2 months for [Virtual Fitness Buddy](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-afterschool) that succeeded with adults but was unintuitive for children. This led to a design change in the overall project, incorporating a touchscreen, which was intuitive for children to use. <!-- TODO: is this additional sentence good??? -->

    <summary>Skills</summary>

- Realized the Virtual Buddy systems by synthesizing and implementing the needs of the entire spectrum of stakeholders from child players, their parents, and deployment site staff like CMOA, to supporting UGA staff of psychologists, statisticians, kinesiologists, and engineers to turn a proof of concept into fully realized applications played by 60,000 children over 5 years
<!-- - turn this into bullet point as elevator pitch on why I was good in field; got it deployed and all they had to do was plug in; captured data when working that met needs of departments involved; app worked for kids; work with parents; was easy on site staff b/c only plugin and turn on tv; managed stakeholders across domains well
  - tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation
  - things to note:
    - site staff: kiosk designed for anyone to rollout and setup; worked with them to setup app bounds (safety)
    - professors/researchers: data logging automatically inside app; designed to their requirements
    - kids: able to engage and use app
    - parents: easy to use website for reviews; able to play with app
  - situation: designing, implementing, and troubleshooting VFB app
  - task: buy in across domains; certain requirements for different folks
  - actions: meet design requirements for site staff and researchers; make engaging and intuitive to use for players
  - Evolution:
    - While designing and implementing VFB apps, I needed to keep design requirements for various stakeholders in mind
    - Designed and implemented VFB apps according to requirements from 4 stakeholder groups (site staff, researchers, children, and parents)
      - think of this as selling these stakeholders on VFB app
      - didn't just apply to design and implementation; also applied throughout lifetime and several deployments of app
    - Designed and maintained VFB apps based on implementation requirements from 4 stakeholder groups throughout study
      - doesn't really emphasize what I did
    - Updated and maintained VFB app based on feedback from 4 stakeholder groups throughout study
    - Designed and updated VFB app to accommodate quick and easy setup and observation by site staff, data logging for researchers, easy of use and entertaining requirement from players (child and parent)
    - Accommodated stakeholder requirements/feedback while designing and updating VFB app, including setup by site staff, automated data logging for researchers, and ease of use and engagement for both child and parent players
    - Designed and maintained (implemented?) VFB apps while accommodating stakeholders, including easy of setup for site staff, automatic data logging for researchers, and intuitiveness, amplified immersion/engagement(?), and safety for both child and parental players
  - Don't really like the direction I went but has been hard to break away from it so moving on for now
    - maybe spearheaded
    - Accommodated stakeholder requirements and feedback...
  - one thing I don't like here is that some of these were anticipatory and not really requirements, ex: ease of setup for site staff
  - Anticipated and accommodated stakeholder requirements and feedback...
- Realized the VFB system by synthesizing and implementing the needs of the entire community of stakeholders by engaging children, parents, and deployment site staff like CMOA as well as by supporting UGA staff of psychologists, statisticians, kinesiologists, and engineers to turn a proof of concept into fully realized applications played by 60,000 children over 5 years

- <!--Led and a-->Architected the [Virtual STEM Buddy experience](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-stem-buddy-at-museum) from conception to implementation which resulted in a 5 year exhibit at the Children's Museum of Atlanta[^vsb1] played by approximately 60,000 children.
- <!-- TODO: as team lead-->Orchestrated the [afterschool Virtual Fitness Buddy project](Projects/vb-overview#virtual-fitness-buddy-afterschool) that launched to over 300 children across 12 sites and ran 6 months[^vfb-a1].<!-- TODO: include c2 or just c1 (155child, 7)sites?? -->

    <summary>Skills</summary>

- Designed ETL (TODO: acronym) process to handle virtual buddy player loading under 3 seconds to retain child attention during start up
- Analyzed initial VSB deployment mechanics at CMOA and recommended upgrade resulted in 58% increase (88.3 / 139.8) in engagement with an approximate 14,000 exhibit visitors per year <!-- with 39% increase (13.6 / 18.9) in LH plays/day between upgrades 2 and 3 and in corresponding time frame slingshot saw 9% increase (23.7 / 25.8); 58% (88.3 / 139.8) in play time/game and 15% (100.0 / 115.3) for slingshot -->
- Created VFB data dictionary reducing comprehension time by 14 hours during impact and success analysis of VFB 
<!-- - TODO: fix this: Created a data dictionary that reduced the 4 person analysis team's time to understand VFB by 14 hours per person across 5 iterations 
  - Note: 4 person analysis team; 14 hours reduced; 5 VFB iterations
  - Created data dictionary which reduced time needed (necessary?) to interpret variables by 14 hours per analysis team member across 5 VFB iterations
  - Created data dictionary which reduced parameter interpretation time by 14 hours per analysis team member across 5 VFB iterations
  - Created data dictionary for VFB analysis team which reduced parameter interpretation time by 14 hours per member across 5iterations
  - Created data dictionary for VFB analysis team which reduced interpretation time by 14 hours per member across 5 iterations
  - Created VFB data dictionary which reduced interpretation time by 14 hours per analysis team member across 5 iterations
  - Created VFB data dictionary which reduced analysis team('s) interpretation time by 14 hours per member across 5 iterations
  - Created VFB data dictionary which reduced each analysis team member's interpretation time by 14 hours across 5 iterations
  - NOTE: Comprend/comprehension might be a good word to use too (instead of interpret/interpretation)
  - NOTE: keep data over parameter since data dictionary is a term? Yes do in regards to data dictionary as a phrase
  - Created VFB data dictionary which reduced each analysis team member's comprehension time by 14 hours across 5 iterations
  - Created VFB data dictionary reducing comprehension time by 14 hours during impact and success analysis of VFB -->
