### Notes and brainstorming
Working Ideas
<!--- Working Ideas --->
- I designed a way to be intentional about interactions in a system where there are no physical buttons where expression is free form.
- chose off the shelf hardware and able to implement architecture evolved we were able to introduce new hardware with minimal rework -- didn't spend grant money on custom hardware
- Was able to maximize developed content by using as easter eggs to encourage play and discovery and reward intrinsic sense of discovery, ask questions and explore limits of system
- I was aware of considering ways of targeting personally identifiable information, included facial recognition and body motions.
  - Didn't want to identify face or who just that **someone** was there
- Safeguarded child privacy by avoiding capturing and storing personally identifiable information, such as facial recognition.

Working Topics:

- Iterative design with feedback:
  - I did this. The feedback was from the kids, parents, and the rest of our team
  - Iterative across projects and within projects too
- Design with edu goals in mind
  - worked with Kinesiologist and Psychologist for VFB; worked with Psychologist and museum staff for VSB
  - adapted our study goals into design decisions, iterating based on feedback
- Lead team of undergrads (collab with external partners)
- Degree is in engineering with a focus on building unique virtual experiences
- worked with Unity3D and C# for over a decade
- Often given the high level goals for the experience then translated those into executable program designs
- Worked on a fast time scale due to study time requirements (ex: in 5 years, we ran 5 studies all with different, iterated prototypes); had to test prototypes on the fly in order to discover what felt good to us and translated well to kids (used kids of study investigators for early testing then pilot studies with kids in similar environment to main study target)
- Had to work with a team from multiple backgrounds (engineering, stats, psychology, kinesiology) and worked with various site staff to properly target environmental needs
- Primary game designer on various projects
- I did have to dabble in animations based on models designed by other members from our team
- Modeled determinant trajectories while also leveraging the physics engine for bounciness and other traits

#### Iterative design with feedback


- took in feedback from site staff to better accommodate their specific (environmental) needs
- for the virtual buddy apps, they literally were built and grew upon each other
  - took feedback from the current study and used it to target things to update or address in the next iteration

TODO: tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation

- From the site staff, I garnered feedback regarding how well the system was working in the field and quickly prototyped and tested updates before deploying them in the field as necessary.

- These updates were made both in between and during studies, pending the severity of the issue.
  - some were also made if participants had not reached certain points in the game, meaning that they would not impact study goals as much before and after their implementation as they were implemented before they even got to try them
- Worked on 5 different virtual buddy projects that drew inspiration from previous applications.

We had anywhere from a few weeks to 3 months to finish up the next prototype for use in the field.

TODO: Iterative design process 

- took in feedback from multidisciplinary team on prototypes

Based on feedback from our multiple disciplinary team, study site staff, and participants, I built and iterated upon various virtual buddy systems (page link?).

- From our multiple disciplinary team, I garnered feedback regarding alignment with larger study goals and adjusted designs accordingly to better target these goals.
  - psychology (communications), statistics, kinesiology, and engineering
  - p/s/k, presented weekly prototypes for feedback
  - engr, 
  - pet health = old PA*0.9 + new PA*0.1


TODO: add "advertisement" for all projects on this page, maybe dupe it on landing page (teaser for what it is, pic, and link for further info and/or demo)

##### Bringing four departments together

Psyc+kine = here's what we want
engr = here's how to do it
Stats = here's how it did and other data metrics

##### Participant feedback

- From child participants, I garnered feedback on the application interactions including what they enjoyed or found frustrating.

Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback.

in person, anecdotal, live feedback
end of study questionnaire feedback
game performance and metrics

- TODO: add a bullet point for how we managed our feedback collection process

Selection techniques - hover select to 3D keyboard to touchscreen
Minigame mechanics - hated blaster


##### Site Feedback

STEM buddy

TODO: how to reach out to the community to get them involved
TODO: architectural tradeoffs of tablet placement and ground markers and gameplay+safety

Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span.

##### Iterative Design Stuff

bi weekly meetings and iterations

story about time when quickly innovated with feedback from partners

split goal and PA

Iterated bi weekly for VFB on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. 

TODO: novel hardware choices (kinect, novint falcon)

into gameplay stats

 impacted game design decisions

stat: data collection and gathering
psyc/kine: PA to VFB impact
psyc: minigames, overall design, skeleton
paper writing

##### Unity/Programming Stuff

TODO: unreal blueprint system
TODO: cool unity stuff

Multiplatform

I was able to take my vfb and port it easily with minimal changes using engine native capabilities for ios, android, vr, kinect

preprocessor directives, conditional compilation

Designed VFB architecture in s

Implemented modular design in VFB project and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.

to use Unity3D multiplatform deployment for VFB ()

TODO: simulation - fwim
TODO: navigation - heart tour

Understanding trade offs of user experience and navigation

recognize that the value of experience was guided navigation and not free form nav - focus energy on importance of the tour itself rather than the novel concept of 3d heart to explore

worrying about navigation

not free form with no rails but targeted a technique that let them forget about navigation

with a novel navigation system - on track, compact, didn't care about turns

realized a conceptual 3d modeled heart tour

###### Agility

executed implementation of agility course for VFB using (these systems)
    nav mesh, physics engine, animation state machine, third party libraries

TODO: tell story about owning a minigame start to end in Unity

language that I owned and executed vision

target blank canvas?

conceptualized and realized

###### Bark It

TODO: tell story about owning a minigame an accessible minigame

bark it more accessible 
Implemented a minigame that targeted 

Included an experience that targeted non-gamers - broadening audience.

wanted overall project to appeal to a variety of people instead of just gamers

widen/expanded target audience

Wanted to implement a minigame that did not rely on having good gamer skills

reduced input requirements

inclusivity

language that I owned and executed vision

target blank canvas?

conceptualized and realized


executing my vision for the minigame

## Blueprints for bullet points

### Blank Canvas

- things where I owned product start to finish (minigames)
- things where I took initiative to lead something (cross-group initiatives)
  - example undergrad focus
- anything where given vague direction, ex stem minigame

### Architectural

- TODO: novel hardware choices (kinect, novint falcon), off the shelf hardware choices (software too?) - tradeoff between novel hardware vs readily available/familiar
- TODO: heart navigation/learning trade-off (software/ux) - deciding how someone should experience it, which impacts what systems would need to be made or used ex 1DOF vs 3DOF
- TODO: clear software examples of tradeoffs
  - maybe api - fitbit sync through app is bad
  - where did I have god (good) intuitive sense
    - think of examples: to touchscreen or not to touchscreen
    - talk about why you would choose one over the other

### Small Prototypes - have deliverable

- minigames as example of small prototype in terms of the larger virtual experience (VFB, VSB, F&V)
- initial VFB VR demo
- TODO: write small tools to improve productivity (controller input tester, data structure testing)
- class project games, bonus playable
- shop system, level up system maybe?

### Working Scrappy - testing

- understanding limited resources
- working scrappy with cost and kids may not be able to read
  - not every kid has iPad
- limited resources
- where to spend innovation tokens, ex maybe not mid-air interactions or custom fitbit syncing
- ex: testing things outside the context of the larger virtual experience

### External Partners

- TODO: tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation

### Game Engine proficiency

- see TODOs above about unity
- any other points I want to hit?
- TODO: state machine for vfb/vsb animations and maybe arduino??
  - maybe use this to target narrative/interactive dialogue

### Programming Languages

- examples of where I problem solved in C#
  - what wasn't just looking up name of function
- maybe go ahead and hit python too?
- PANDAs and Seaborn experiences?
- TODO: (programming): notebook on what system stats mean, documentation
  - what I did to make it more effective for other folks to dev with the existing system
  - more specialized audience

### 3D assets, animations, and models

- worked with art team 
- made minor animation and model adjustments where needed
- NERVE uvula animation

### Physics and other simulations

- see above TODOs, ex: agility see-saw
- trajectory system?
- heart minigames - artery elasticity; novint falcon work

### Educational goal alignment

- examples of where I work furthered educational goals
- where I focused people to achieve edu goals they may not have thought of
- ex projects: NERVE, Heart, VSB, maybe touch on VFB
  - entertainment is primary deliverable with education being secondary deliverable even though it's primary goal because if they don't keep playing, it will not educate
- academic advisor that improved student learning outcomes (ex statics studies? maybe the arya maze study??)

### External partners or stakeholders

- what were some of the experiences working with interdepartmental work
- what I bring to table to convert their goals into game design vision
- examples of integrating stakeholder feedback
  - more specifically: how did I keep the goal of VFB fun and motivating fitness while keeping the requirements from the various departments
    - tradeoff between requirements
    - meeting needs while keeping app fun
- fitbit tech support, working with parents

### Define technical and design requirements

- leading undergrad team here
- documentation on how to work in/with systems that I already created
- anything that made people more productive
  - how did artists succeed working with me
- how did site staff succeed in implementing our project requirements
- how did we design hardware to minimize failure/easy recovery from failure
  - restart on crash
  - tv must be on pop up
  - one plug and mobile kiosk for ease of setup and breakdown
