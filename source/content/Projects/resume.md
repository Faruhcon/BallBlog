## About me

<!--- final-ish bullet points --->
- Designed child intuitive, motion-detection interaction algorithm for using real-world motion as a primary input system used by xxx ((thousands of)) children (prior to the release of the consumer Oculus Rift virtual reality headset in 2015). TODO: add numbers
- Optimized input system to accommodate real-world interference and physical safety constraints for elementary school lunchroom and children's museum exhibit environments.
- Collaborated with psychology, kinesiology, engineering, and statistics departments to design an engaging physical activity improvement program validated by game analytics.
- Translated child feedback into actionable design updates to gameplay mechanics that eliminated negative feedback.
- Integrated Children's Museum of Atlanta deployment requirements into Virtual STEM Buddy mixed reality exhibit that had no reported physical incidents over 5 year life span.
- Iterated bi weekly for VFB on 4 separate departments' requirements that both entertained children and supported physical activity gameplay goals. 
- Implemented modular design in VFB project and utilized Unity3D's ease of cross-platform deployment to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest) builds.
- Implemented virtual reality tour of 3D modeled heart using Unity3D that competed at the 2016 IEEEVR Conference. TODO: link paper and demo paper, video??
- Expanded the boundaries of a VR guided heart tour to give an audience-focused, exploratory experience with minimal navigation friction that improved accessibility. (TODO: cite heartx2)
- Designed a virtual reality exploratory data analysis (EDA) tool using Unity3D to simplify understanding of heart study interactions (TODO: cite all 3 fwim+2 heart).

<!--- Non-Erin Approved (lol) --->
- Designed robust system used by xxx children across yyy sites which continued to run daily with minimal upkeep for zzz years. TODO: add numbers
- Architected application using MVC & MVVM design patterns to decouple modules for scaling the project.
- ~~Implemented portable designs to support PC, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and Virtual Reality (Meta Quest).~~
  - TODO: describe new hardware and new environments as new bullet point(s), buzz word: portability

### Notes and brainstorming
Working Ideas
<!--- Working Ideas --->
- I designed a way to be intentional about interactions in a system where there are no physical buttons where expression is free form.
- chose off the shelf hardware and able to implement architecture evolved we were able to introduce new hardware with minimal rework -- didn't spend grant money on custom hardware
- Was able to maximize developed content by using as easter eggs to encourage play and discovery and reward intrinsic sense of discovery, ask questions and explore limits of system
- I was aware of considering ways of targeting personally identifiable information, included facial recognition and body motions.
  - Didn't want to identify face or who just that **someone** was there
- Safeguarded child privacy by avoiding capturing and storing personally identifiable information, such as facial recognition.

Working Topics:

- Iterative design with feedback:
  - I did this. The feedback was from the kids, parents, and the rest of our team
  - Iterative across projects and within projects too
- Design with edu goals in mind
  - worked with Kinesiologist and Psychologist for VFB; worked with Psychologist and museum staff for VSB
  - adapted our study goals into design decisions, iterating based on feedback
- Lead team of undergrads (collab with external partners)
- Degree is in engineering with a focus on building unique virtual experiences
- worked with Unity3D and C# for over a decade
- Often given the high level goals for the experience then translated those into executable program designs
- Worked on a fast time scale due to study time requirements (ex: in 5 years, we ran 5 studies all with different, iterated prototypes); had to test prototypes on the fly in order to discover what felt good to us and translated well to kids (used kids of study investigators for early testing then pilot studies with kids in similar environment to main study target)
- Had to work with a team from multiple backgrounds (engineering, stats, psychology, kinesiology) and worked with various site staff to properly target environmental needs
- Primary game designer on various projects
- I did have to dabble in animations based on models designed by other members from our team
- Modeled determinant trajectories while also leveraging the physics engine for bounciness and other traits
- TODO:
  - Architectural stuff: identify challenges and articulate trade-offs
  - Physics engine - engine vs pre-determined
  - AR, VR, MR - literally everything
  - Data engineering stuff

#### Iterative design with feedback


- took in feedback from site staff to better accommodate their specific (environmental) needs
- for the virtual buddy apps, they literally were built and grew upon each other
  - took feedback from the current study and used it to target things to update or address in the next iteration

TODO: tech support bullet point regarding site staff feedback and implementation

- From the site staff, I garnered feedback regarding how well the system was working in the field and quickly prototyped and tested updates before deploying them in the field as necessary.

- These updates were made both in between and during studies, pending the severity of the issue.
  - some were also made if participants had not reached certain points in the game, meaning that they would not impact study goals as much before and after their implementation as they were implemented before they even got to try them
- Worked on 5 different virtual buddy projects that drew inspiration from previous applications.

We had anywhere from a few weeks to 3 months to finish up the next prototype for use in the field.

TODO: Iterative design process
