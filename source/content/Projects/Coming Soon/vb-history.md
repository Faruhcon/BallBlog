# Virtual Buddy Development History
</div>

COMING SOON

TODO: intro

During my studies, several of my projects focus on utilizing virtual buddies to motivate children to achieve some goal, such as learning STEM concepts or engaging in healthier physical activity habits.These projects were built iteratively, learning and building upon the earlier ones. The goal of this page is to provide an overview of some of these major changes and why they were made. Further details on these projects can be found on their individual pages.

* TODO: timeline image like a usual timeline but have boxes that include the info for each project in boxes
* TODO: Two evolution maps: one for hardware and another for software
  * Maybe do smaller ones for each subsection showing the evolution for each category?


* TODO: timeline image
* TODO: evolution map - one master or several sub-maps?

Insert discussion and chart for overview of participant data across all of the VFB studies

Header: ??? System Overview

insert the kiosk, ipad, and headset pictures here? or break them up between paragraphs? which looks better

Various systems were used throughout the lifetime of the VFB project. Our first two systems (refx2?) utilized a mobile kiosk which consisted of a large screen TV along with a PC and Microsoft Kinect (ref?), where children used their physical bodies as the primary method of interacting with their VFB (fig ref?). The idea was to avoid having the children engage in sedentary activity when playing with their VFB while also mimicking real life motions to aid in fostering the bond between a child and their VFB. From both these early studies and the Virtual STEM Buddy (VSB) (make into link to its page) project, we learned that utilizing a touchscreen for more complex selection interactions was much easier and understandable over mid-air interaction techniques with the Kinect. Thus, we added a touchscreen to the second iteration of our kiosk (fig ref?). 

These kiosks were designed to be used in public spaces. Thus with the onset of the COVID pandemic, we needed to change our approach to continue conducting these studies. This resulted in our iPad iteration of the VFB system (ref) (fig ref?). We sought to keep as much of the real-world movement as possible, utilizing augmented reality (AR) techniques for camera movement and aiming while utilizing the touchscreen through the use of digital joysticks and buttons for locomotion and throwing. Additionally, we were better able to utilize voice activated interactions for performing tricks as the microphone would be close to the child while they interacted with their VFB. This shift allowed the VFB system to be usable in many different home setups.

The last iteration of the VFB system I worked on was the immersive, virtual reality (VR) based system which utilized the Meta Quest 2 (dissertation ref?). We returned to the real world movement of our kiosk-based VFB systems, adapting several of the minigames to the new explorable VFB world designed for the iPad-based VFB system. I also briefly worked on early prototypes of the watch companion app that was in development as I was graduating. This was an idea my professor and I had talked about for a long time. The watch app would allow children to take their VFB with them on walks, which we thought would help foster their bond.

Add references to papers here as footnotes?

Some additional notes:

While all version of vfb had voice activation, it was often hard to use in the afterschool settings because loud

Our second iteration of this kiosk added a touchscreen because mid air interaction hard

This journey began in summer camp settings

more details for each of these projects can be found...

learned and grew from the older projects and also vb-f&v and vsb-m, which will be discussed in more detail on the following pages

something something (on the specific page for it): tried to have the physical fitness go down but we were too harsh on it and for the sake of the study, opted to remove this feature as we did not have time to properly test it in the lab before the next iterations
