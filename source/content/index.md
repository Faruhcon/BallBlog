Hello! My name is Dr. Catherine Ball, and I'm a massive nerd. This website includes info regarding the projects I have worked on since I started learning how to program many years ago with the latest one being this website actually! I used this as an opportunity to learn more about Markdown, HTML, and CSS. It was built using Quartz (linked below). 

You can learn more about me, my qualifications, my projects, and my papers on the following pages:
* [About Me](/about-me): Info about me and my qualifications
* [Game Portfolio Overview](/game-portfolio): Info about projects I worked on
* [Virtual Buddy Projects Overview](/vb-overview): Info specifically about the virtual buddy projects I worked on
* [Papers](/papers): Info about academic articles I wrote or participated in writing and/or designed the application utilized
